# Radio Storm Monitoring Stations (RSMS)

The RSMS series consists of research-grade lightning monitoring stations operating in two complementary frequency domains:

| Model               | Band                 | Function                                  | Key feature                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [RSMS01](./RSMS01/) | **UHF (~400 MHz)**   | Detailed structure of lightning breakdown | Active QFH antenna array, GNSS time-stamping             |
| [RSMS02](./RSMS02/) | **VLF (20–500 kHz)** | Trigger and long-range detection          | Multi-loop antenna array with on-board processing |

## Concept Overview

The RSMS system is designed for multi-band radio detection of lightning. While RSMS02 provides reliable VLF triggering and coarse localization, RSMS01 captures the fine-scale UHF signatures of the lightning events. Both units operate time-synchronously and can be combined for interferometric and correlation analyses with optical, E-field, or radiation sensors.

## Applications

* Coordinated observation of lightning discharges
* Study of spatial and temporal characteristics of leaders
* Multi-band correlation with optical, EFM, or radiation detectors
* Calibration of atmospheric electromagnetic models
