# RSMS02 – VLF Radio Storm Monitoring Station

RSMS02 is a Very Low Frequency (VLF) lightning mapping station designed for detection, recording, and triggering of lightning-related electromagnetic signals. It serves as the low-frequency counterpart to [RSMS01](/RSMS01/), generating triggers for simultaneous UHF recording and enabling synchronized multi-band observation of atmospheric electrical activity.

## Functional Overview

The station uses a three-axis loop antenna array to capture the magnetic component of VLF emissions from lightning discharges. The loops can be deployed either on a stationary platform or mounted on a vehicle roof for mobile campaigns. Each loop feeds a high-speed digitizer implemented on the [ADCoctoSPI01](https://www.mlab.cz/module/ADCoctoSPI01/) MLAB module, which provides low-noise analog front-end amplification, variable gain control, and high-resolution conversion. The station’s embedded processing unit manages data capture, triggering, and network communication.

The RSMS02 station continuously monitors the VLF spectrum and identifies events using an energy-based algorithm implemented in FPGA logic. When a threshold is exceeded for a defined duration, a TTL trigger pulse is issued to the connected instruments, such as RSMS01 or high-speed optical systems. The triggering mechanism ensures that even short-duration lightning impulses are captured while minimizing false positives from narrowband interference.

## Front-End and Digitizer

The digitizer module [ADCoctoSPI01](https://www.mlab.cz/module/ADCoctoSPI01/) integrates an eight-channel TI AFE5801 chip, providing variable gain amplifiers and 12-bit ADCs with LVDS output. In RSMS02, three of these channels are used for the orthogonal loop antennas. The analog front-end features fine (0.125 dB) and coarse (1 dB) gain steps, ensuring accurate signal scaling over a wide dynamic range. Signal linearity and low noise make the system suitable for quantitative analysis of electromagnetic field intensity and waveform structure.

To minimize interference, the antenna shields follow a star-ground topology, and the loop outputs are galvanically isolated from the chassis. Each channel maintains consistent phase characteristics for accurate vector reconstruction of lightning directionality.

## System Operation

During operation, the station continuously monitors the incoming magnetic field signals. When the energy content within the configured time window exceeds the threshold, the event is stored locally, and a trigger is propagated to auxiliary devices. Operators can monitor signal levels, trigger thresholds, and data capture via a web-based interface or command-line tools. Data files include binary waveform streams with sidecar metadata that describe timestamping, gain settings, and antenna configuration.

For field deployment, the loop array can be mounted orthogonally on a lightweight frame attached to the roof of a measurement vehicle or on a fixed building. The electronics enclosure is weather-protected, and the system can be powered directly from the vehicle’s DC bus.

## Data Format

Each recording contains:

* Three-channel VLF waveform data (12-bit, 10 MS/s)
* PPS timestamps and internal counters
* Configuration metadata (gain, trigger settings, decimation)

These files can be analyzed using post-processing tools for event classification, correlation with UHF data from RSMS01, or temporal matching with optical and radiation sensors.
