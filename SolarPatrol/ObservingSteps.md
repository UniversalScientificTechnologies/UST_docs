# Observing with the Telescope

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Powering On the Telescope

1. **Open the Dome:**

The dome should be ventilated until the temperature is equivalent to the outside temperature. This procedure takes from 20 to 40 minutes.  Therefore the dome should be opened approximately an hour before observation in winter and half an hour before in summer to avoid thermal turbulences. 

   - Only open the dome in good weather conditions.
   - Release the latch mechanism to unlock the dome.
   - Use the wheel to open the dome slit carefully.

2. **Prepare the System:**

   - Ensure all switches on the control panel are in the off position.
   - Visually inspect the telescope. Check that all control elements are in their proper positions, ensure there are no obstructions that could interfere with the telescope's movement, and confirm that no components are at risk of damage.

3. **Turn on  central Power:**

First, turn on the power switch located on the wall near the staircase.

4. **Activate Components:**

   - After inspecting the telescope
   - switch on Electronics and Motor Power on the control panel. Both switches should be activated in a short time one after one (from left to right).
   - Wait for the 5V, 12V, and CPU indicators to light up.
   - Allow the system to initialize. This process includes movements for automatic calibration of the mount and may take a few minutes. The movements are quite noisy.

### Setting Up the Telescope

1. **Align the Dome:**

   - Use the wired remote controller to rotate the dome.
   - Press the `<` or `>` buttons to align the dome slit with the Sun.
   - During any movement, it is essential to ensure that there are no obstructions and the dome can rotate freely.

2. **Adjust the Mount:**

   - Utilize the RA (Right Ascension) and DEC (Declination) controls on the remote.
   - Center the Sun in the telescope's field of view by pressing the corresponding directional buttons.

3. **Fine-Tune Settings:**

   - Adjust focus using the `FOCUS+` and `FOCUS-` buttons on the remote controller.
   - Regulate the light intensity with the `CLONA+` and `CLONA-` buttons.

### Observing the Sun

3. **Track the Sun:**

   - Enable the time axis tracking using the remote or web interface.
   - Verify that the telescope smoothly follows the Sun's movement across the sky.

### Powering Off the Telescope

1. **Disable Tracking:**

   - Turn off the time axis tracking via the interface or wired controller.

2. **Shut Down the System:**

   - Ensure the system has fully powered down. Confirm that the `CPU` LED on the control panel is not blinking (wait at least 5 seconds).
   - Switch off the `Motor Power` and `Electronics` switches.
   - Turn off the main power switch to cut electricity to the system.

3. **Close the Dome:**

   - Place the telescope in a parking position to ensure it is not exposed to rain through the dome's ventilation opening.
   - Ensure the dome is fully closed and secured with latch mechanism

## Additional Notes

- Always monitor the system for any irregularities during operation.
- For further assistance, refer to the troubleshooting guide or contact technical support.
