# Solar Patrol Telescope

The Solar Patrol Telescope is a unique assembly of telescopes designed for regular and detailed solar observations. It is located at the [Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Ond≈ôejov](https://www.asu.cas.cz/en/about/about-the-institute) and primarily serves scientific purposes. The main aim of the Solar Patrol Service is to provide daily monitoring of solar activity, including high-quality imaging and manual sketches of the Sun's photosphere.

The latest modernization of this facility was implemented by [Universal Scientific Technologies s.r.o.](https://www.ust.cz/) in 2017. The goal of this renovation was to create a semi-automated system that minimizes the need for operator intervention.

The assembly includes several specialized telescopes tailored for different aspects of solar observation, such as the chromosphere, photosphere, and sketching solar phenomena.

The telescope control system utilizes [MLAB electronic modules](https://www.mlab.cz/) controlled by an Odroid C2 single-board computer. The software is based on open-source platforms [ROSv1](https://www.ros.org/) and [AROM](https://github.com/Robozor-network/AROM), enabling efficient functionality expansion.
