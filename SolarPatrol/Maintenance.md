# Telescope Maintenance

Regular maintenance of the Solar Patrol Telescope is essential to ensure its proper functionality and longevity. This guide provides instructions for routine and preventive maintenance tasks.

## Mechanical Maintenance

### Quarterly Maintenance

In specific conditions, such as increased dust, higher levels of pollen, or airborne particles, this maintenance should be performed more frequently.

1. **Verify Lubrication:**
   - Ensure that all moving parts are properly lubricated.
   - Confirm that moving components operate smoothly and without resistance.
   - Clean the components to remove any buildup of dust or debris.
   - Apply a small amount of lubricant to the moving elements.

2. **Annual Cleaning:**
   - Thoroughly clean all lubricated areas at least once a year.
   - Replace old or degraded lubricant with fresh, high-quality grease or oil.

3. **Inspect Fastenings:**
   - Check that no components have loosened due to vibrations.
   - Tighten any loose parts and ensure that no parts are at risk of becoming loose.

4. **Check Movement Clearance:**
   - Verify that moving elements do not rub against or obstruct other parts of the system.

1. **Deep Clean the System:**
   - Remove accumulated dust from the dome interior and telescope body.
   - Inspect all external surfaces for signs of wear or corrosion.
